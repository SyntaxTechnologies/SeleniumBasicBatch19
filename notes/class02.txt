*****************************Selenium 02**************************
  What is a WebElement?
    anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
    e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links


 What is DOM?
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
    internal view of the webpage.
    Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
    Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
    Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
    Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

locators.

1. id
2. name
3. class (classname)
4.tagname

note:
for tagname ---> if there are multiple elements with the same tag, the first one in the DOM will be selected
precatuions:
1. what ever locator that you choose please make sure it is unqiue enough,
2. we should avoid the locstors that have digits and spaces.



In case of duplicate locator:
if in case u used a locator that had a duplicate value, selenium is going to find the first one and interact with it.

==.linktext:

1.the element must be in "a" tag , a tag is also called anchor tag and it usually contains links
2.the element must have some text
if one of the condition is not fullfiled u cant use the linktext locator

==partial linktext:(  u can use partial text to locate elements)
1.the element must be in "a" tag , a tag is also called anchor tag and it usually contains links
2.the element must have some text
if one of the condition is not fullfiled u cant use the linktext locator



==webElements commands


2.gettext()--> get the text out of the element (if there is no text in the webelement it will return nothing)
3.getAttribute(attribute value)--> get the value of a attribute
