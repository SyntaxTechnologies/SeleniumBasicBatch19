..............................................Drop Down.....................................................

 Drop Down:

 Two types:

 Single select
 Multi-select
 When it comes to drop-downs, we have a class in Selenium that helps us interact with them:

 Select class - in order to be able to use this class, your dropdown must be made in the DOM using the SELECT tag.
 Single Select Drop Down Approach:

 Inspect the dropdown.
 Check if it has the SELECT tag.
 Write down the locator to find the WebElement dropdown.
 Declare an object of the Select class (pass the WebElement in the parameters).
 Use methods from the Select class to select the desired option:
 selectByVisibleText();
 selectByValue();
 selectByIndex();


 Multi-Select Drop Down Approach:

 Inspect the dropdown.
 Check if it has the SELECT tag.
 Write down the locator to find the WebElement dropdown.
 Declare an object of the Select class (pass the WebElement in the parameters).
 Use methods to select the desired option:
 selectByVisibleText();
 selectByValue();
 selectByIndex();
 You can also use deselect methods in case of a multi-select dropdown.
 To check if the dropdown is multi-select or not, you can use the isMultiple() method, which returns a boolean true if it is a multi-select dropdown.
